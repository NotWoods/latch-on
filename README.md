# Grappling game

Repository for work on a grappling-based video game I've been working on. The first prototype was called 'Latch-on', starring a robot 
I managed to whip up in Blender. The newer design is planned to feature
a [thread-and-needle based character](https://github.com/NotWoods/latch-on/blob/master/Graphics/chracter.png).
The gameplay has gone through a couple different implementations, but now uses a custom system based on raycasts rather than Box2D bodies.
For now, the game has gone back to using greyboxing for its graphics until I can put more features and levels together.
The game currently uses Unity 5.5.
